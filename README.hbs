### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/bvalyou/react-form-state-hooks#readme)

## Install

```sh
npm install react-form-state-hooks
```

## Browser Compatibility

This library uses ES2020 methods, so for developers supporting legacy browsers or server-side JS environments,
polyfills will be needed.

## Performance Considerations

This is designed for controlled forms, which solve some problems but come with some performance challenges when managed
centrally. To avoid this, it's recommended to add basic memoization to all inputs being controlled, as well as any
nested form sections.

## üöÄ Usage

There are currently two pieces available, the main file which provides the hooks and utilities,
and a secondary file, context, that provides utilities for using form state propagation through
React's Context feature.

### useFormState

```js
import { useFormState, useListFormState, createOnChange } from 'react-form-state-hooks';
```

`useFormState` is the primary hook for managing a form's state. Alone it isn't very powerful, but it
has a recursive interface that allows it to provide state management for complex form structures.
Used with a React Context (and the Context Utilities below) it provides robust logic with a minimum
of boilerplate.

There is a simple example of this in
<a href="https://github.com/bvalyou/react-form-state-hooks/blob/master/stories/basicFormExample/BasicForm.js">the examples</a>.

### useListFormState

`useListFormState` takes an array of data and exposes it with a similar interface as `useFormState`.
It supports simple add/remove and with proper memoization can prevent unnecessary renders for large
lists.

There is a simple example of this in
<a href="https://github.com/bvalyou/react-form-state-hooks/blob/master/stories/listFormExample/FormWithList.js">the examples</a>.

### Context Utilities

```js
import { FormStateContext, connectFormStateInput } from 'react-form-state-hooks/context';
```

`FormStateContext` is a React Context for providing the current `formState` or `listFormState` to a set of components.

```jsx harmony
<FormStateContext.Provider value={useListFormState()}>
	...
</FormStateContext.Provider>
```

Apart from assisting with the prop-drilling issue, this context also allows you to reduce the boilerplate for writing
your form, using the provided `connectFormStateInput` higher-order component.

```jsx harmony
const ConnectedInput = connectFormStateInput('input');

<FormStateContext.Provider value={useListFormState()}>
	<label htmlFor="foo">Foo</label>
	<ConnectedInput id="foo" name="foo" />
</FormStateContext.Provider>
```

`connectFormStateInput` links the provided component to `FormStateContext`, and will derive the `value` (or `checked`)
prop, and bind the `onChange` callback.

You can see these utilities in action in the examples
<a href="https://github.com/bvalyou/react-form-state-hooks/blob/master/stories/contextExample/ContextForm.js">the examples</a>.
